Toy Robot!

There is a grid, like a chessboard.
64x64 squares wide, and tall.
Your robot, (can be an emoji) starts somewhere in the grid.

Provide four control buttons:
left, right, up, down

When you press these buttons, the robot should move one square in the direction indicated.
However, if the robot is at the top of the board and you press up, it shouldn't move.

P.S: Consider separating your move functions for it into another class :D
