Toy Robot!

There is a grid, like a chessboard.
64x64 squares wide, and tall.
Your robot, (can be an emoji) starts somewhere in the grid.

Provide four control buttons:
left, right, up, down

When you press these buttons, the robot should move one square in the direction indicated.
However, if the robot is at the top of the board and you press up, it shouldn't move.

P.S: Consider separating your move functions for it into another class :D



NEXT!
1. Let the number of squares be dynamically set. Test that it works with 4, squares and 2^30 squares.
2. Allow for obstacles to be added to the course. Obstacles can be randomly placed and also prohibit
	movement into the square where they appear
3. Slippy slide, slippy slides continue to move your bot one step ahead, in the direction that your bot entered the slippy slide tile.
4. Multiplayer, allow another person to connect to your game and appear within it. The two of you can't occupy the same slide at the same time.
